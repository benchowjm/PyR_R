## Building your Function Vocabulary ##

Preface: This markdown file assumes that you have done at least one of the introductory online courses mentioned in the main page, and have gotten a basic feel of working with the R console. If you haven't, head to [CodeSchool](http://tryr.codeschool.com) now to get started.

### 1. Exploring objects in the workspace ###

After working with R for some time, you may end up having many objects in your workspace.  The following list of commands will help you retrieve information about the characteristics about these objects.

Code                      | Notes
--------------------------|--------------------------
`attributes(obj)`         | Many objects from complicated classes (e.g. ggplot, lm) are lists of named, varied components
`names(obj) `             | Some objects have named components. For list-type objects, you can access named sub-components using '$'
`class(obj)`              | An object's type is called its class (e.g. data.frame, numeric, or list)
`str(obj)`                | Shows the structure of the object
`summary(obj)`            | Most useful for variables in a data frame and lm objects
`dim(obj)`                | Gives the dimension of tabular, array-like objects.
`length(obj)`             | Gives the length of 1-dimensional objects, or the number of components in a list-type object

<br><br>

### 2. Programming ###

The following table shows simple control structures and syntax for creating expressions and equations with the objects in your workspace.

Code                      | Notes
--------------------------|----------------------------------
`+  -  *  /  ^`           | Basic arithmetic operations
`t()`                     | Transposes a dataframe or matrix (also coerces the object class into a matrix)
`&  |  !`                 | Logical operators for "and", "or", "not"
`==  !=  <  >  <=  >=`    | Logical tests which return boolean (`TRUE` or `FALSE`) values
`5 %in% c(1, 3, 5)`       | Returns `TRUE` since the value 5 is found in the vector on the right
`any(a, b, c)`            | Returns `TRUE` if either `a`, `b` or `c` is satisfied
`all(a, b, c)`            | Returns `TRUE` if `a`, `b` and `c` are all satisfied
`which(x>5)`              | Which elements in the vector `x` are larger than 5?
`all.equal(x, y)`         | Checks if each component in x is equal to y
`ifelse(expr, A, B)`      | If the `expr` condition is `TRUE`, return `A`, if not return `B`
`for(i in 1:10){do this}` | Creates a __for__ loop iterating from `i=1` to `i=10`
`if(expr){ABC} else{DEF}` | If `expr` is true, execute commands `ABC`. `else` provides the option for specifying a different default where `expr` is false
`apply(df, 2, function)`  | Takes the data frame `df`, applies `function` to each of its columns (`2`)
`lapply(); sapply()`      | Similar to __apply__ but takes lists as their inputs. __sapply__ simplifies the result while __lapply__ leaves it as a list

### 3. Handling Data (Individual Values) ###

Usually, datasets pulled from registry or other sources will be formatted in a less-than-perfect way. You may need functions to transform data values. The following tables mostly work with individual values but will accept vectors as well.

<br>

#### Numeric Data ####

Code                      | Notes
--------------------------|----------------------------------
`round(x, 3)`             | Rounds `x` to 3 decimal places
`signif(x, 3)`            | Rounds `x` to 3 significant figures
`log(); log10(); exp()`   | Natural log; log base 10; exponential
`sin(); cos(); tan()`     | Trigonometric functions
`abs(); sqrt()`           | Absolute; square root
`ceiling(); floor()`      | Round up or down to the nearest integer
`seq(1, 11)`              | Generates a sequence from 1 to 11. Arguments: `by =`
`rep("Hello", 4)`         | Generates a vector of 4 `"Hello"s`

<br>

#### Strings ####

Code                      | Notes
--------------------------|----------------------------------
`paste(x, y)`             | Concatenates x and y into one string. Arguments: `collapse =` or `sep =`.
`grep(); grepl()`         | Functions that search a string for a pattern
`sub(); gsub()`           | Functions that substitute a pattern within a string
`tolower(); toupper()`    | Functions that force a string to all lowercase or uppercase letters
`sub(); gsub()`           | Functions that substitute a pattern within a string
`substr(x, 2, 5)`         | Extracts the 2nd to 5th characters in the string `x`
`nchar()`                 | Counts the number of characters in the string
`strsplit(x, " ")`        | Splits `x` into multiple strings, cutting it every time there is a space

<br>

#### Coercion and Logicals ####

In addition there are 2 important families of functions. The first is for coercion, which is forcing a change of an object from one class to another. The second family tests whether objects correspond to a certain type and are useful for fortifying your code, making it more resilient to irregular data types.  

__Coercion__: `as.numeric(); as.character(); as.data.frame(); as.matrix(); as.list(); as.factor()`  
__Logicals__: `is.numeric(); is.character(); is.data.frame(); is.ggplot(); is.na(); is.nan()`

### 4. Handling Data (Columns of Values) ###

Certain functions are only meaningful when applied to an array of values. These are especially useful for working with variables in a table. These functions mostly derive from in-built packages in R. I will introduce the more powerful data manipulation package `dplyr` in an upcoming page.

<br>

Code                      | Notes
--------------------------|----------------------------------
`cut()`                   | Creates a categorical variable from a continuous variable. Arguments: `breaks =` and `labels = `
`unique()`                | Displays the unique values of a variable. Similar (but not equivalent) to `names(table())`
`subset(df, expr)`        | Subsets out rows of `df` which meet the `expr` condition. Note that typing `df$` is generally not needed
`levels()`                | Displays the values taken by a factor variable
`scale()`                 | Normalizes data into Z-scores
`mean(), median()`        | Mean & Median. Use the argument `na.rm = T` to remove NA values
`quantile()`              | Produces quantiles other than the median, specified in the argument `probs =`
`rank()`                  | Returns the ranks of the values in a variable. Break ties with the argument `ties.method =`
`sort()`                  | Sorts the data in ascending or descending (Argument:`decreasing = F`) order

<br><br>

### 5. Manipulating Data Frames  ###

Finally, we have a series of functions for working with arrays like tables, data frames and matrices. Again, some of these will be superseded by functions in `dplyr` but I present them here for completeness.

Code                      | Notes
--------------------------|----------------------------------
`nrow(); ncol()`          | Like __dim__ but only for 2-dimensional objects like tables
`row.names(); colnames()` | Gives the row & column names of a data frame
`rbind(); cbind()`        | Row- or Column-binding two tables
`merge(); plyr::join()`   | For joining tables. 'plyr::' indicates that you must first load the package "plyr"
`head(); tail()`          | Displays the first or last few rows of a data frame. Use the argument `n = ` for the number of rows
`rowSums(); colSums()`    | Computes the sum of each row or column of a data frame
`rowMeans(); colMeans()`  | Computes the mean of each row or column of a data frame
